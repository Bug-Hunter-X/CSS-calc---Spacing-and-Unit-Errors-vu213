The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, there can be unexpected behavior if spaces are not correctly placed in the calculation. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width:calc(100%-10px);` may not.  Another common issue is trying to use `calc()` with multiple units without proper conversion.
